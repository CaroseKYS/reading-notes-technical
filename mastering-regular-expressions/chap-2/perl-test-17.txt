"Who moved my cheese?"is a story about change that takes place in a Maze where four amusing characters look for "Cheese". Cheese being a metaphor for what we want to have in life, whether it is a job, a relationship, money, a big house, freedom, health, recognition, spiritual peace, or even an activity like jogging or golf. Each of us has our own idea of what Cheese is, and we pursue it because we believe it can makes us happy.

If we get it, we often become attached to it. And if we lose it, or it's taken away, it can be traumatic. The "Maze" in the story represents where you spend time looking for what you want. It can be the organization you work in, the community you live in, or the relationships you have in your life. In the the story you will see that that the two mice do better when they are faced with change because they keep things simple, while the two little people's complex brains and human emotions complicate things.

It is not that mice are smarter. We all know people are more intelligent than mice. However, as you watch what the four characters do, and realize both the mice and the little people represent parts of </br>of ourselves </br> , the simple and the complex, you can see it would be to to our advantage to do the simple things that work when things change.
